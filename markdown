Menstrual hygiene is a basic right — yet millions of girls are missing school every month due to shame and lack of supplies. Diana explores how we can normalize periods and empower girls.

For too long, menstruation has been treated as a taboo. But silence only breeds stigma, and stigma leads to harm.

At *Breaking Barriers with Diana*, we are challenging that silence. This platform will shine a light on real stories — like the girls who found their voice, the communities that created change, and the myths we must dismantle.

Read. Share. Act. Together, we break the silence.
